## Simulation of Single-Stage-Compressor

Utilising a single-stage compressor with a reciprocating compressor to pressurise the air is the major goal of the work

Our main objective is to learn the outcomes described in the aforementioned scope.

• temperature behavior with respect to pressure

• temperature rise in the air bottle vs. time

• mass flow of air in the air bottle vs. Time

• work done on the compressor

All the findings and diagram are displayed in the report.

## Results with fitting diagrams:

The similarity between the obtained diagrams and the ideal diagrams indicates that the results are accurate. Additionally, air mass flow and pressure are rising steadily as expected and are both logically right. We get the same results while manually calculating the quantities with a calculator.

## Comparison of findings with real data:

I used energy conservation equations to compare the data from the simulation to the analytical calculations. The exercise's findings are in line with the data from real time.
The air could not, however, be cooled to suction temperature due to real-world intercooler characteristics. Positively, data variation is significantly below the tolerance level.
The other figures are difficult to compare because they are always dependent on environmental factors such as circumstances, ambient temperatures, air bottle size, and more.

## Benefits of using MATLAB:

Companies who seek to compute results and efficiency to make final judgements can benefit from the simulation. They can determine which compressor best suits their demands by comparing the values of single-stage, two-stage, and three-stage compressors.

## Learnings:

I gained insight into the individual phases and operational methods of a compressor throughout the process. Small adjustments can have a significant effect on the entire system. Additionally, this system's advantage over the one-stage compressor, which has higher power, performance, and complexity, is readily apparent.
